# Upgrading

See [release notes](https://github.com/ZimengXiong/ExcaliDash/releases) for a specific release.

ExcaliDash includes an in-app update notifier that checks GitHub Releases. If your deployment must not make outbound network calls, disable it on the backend:

```bash
UPDATE_CHECK_OUTBOUND=false
```

## Docker Hub Upgrades

If you deployed using `docker-compose.prod.yml` (Docker Hub images), upgrade by pulling the latest images and recreating containers:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull && \
  docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

If you prefer a clean stop/start (more downtime, but simpler), you can do:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down && \
  docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull && \
  docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Notes:

- Don’t add `-v` to `down` unless you intend to delete the persistent backend volume (your SQLite DB + secrets).
- Only add `--remove-orphans` if you previously ran a different Compose file for the same project name and need to remove old/renamed services.

# Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a BETA deployment and production-readiness depends on deployment controls:
> use TLS, trusted reverse proxy, fixed secrets, backups, and endpoint rate limits.

> [!CAUTION]
> ExcaliDash is in BETA. Please backup your data regularly.

## Quickstart

Prereqs: Docker + Docker Compose v2.

<details>
<summary>Docker Hub (Recommended)</summary>

## Docker Hub (Recommended)

```bash
# Download docker-compose.prod.yml
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZimengXiong/ExcaliDash/main/docker-compose.prod.yml

# Pull images
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull

# Run container
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Access the frontend at localhost:6767
```

For single-container deployments, `JWT_SECRET` can be omitted and will be auto-generated and persisted in the backend volume on first start. For portability and most production deployments, set a fixed `JWT_SECRET` explicitly.

By default, the provided Compose files set `TRUST_PROXY=false` for safer setup. Only set `TRUST_PROXY` to a positive hop count (for example, `1`) when requests always pass through a trusted reverse proxy that correctly sets forwarded headers.

<details>
<summary>Docker Build</summary>

## Docker Build

```bash
# Clone the repository (recommended)
git clone git@github.com:ZimengXiong/ExcaliDash.git

# or, clone with HTTPS
# git clone https://github.com/ZimengXiong/ExcaliDash.git

docker compose build
docker compose up -d

# Access the frontend at localhost:6767
```

</details>

## Advanced

The root README keeps the install path short. See
[advanced deployment and operations](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for reverse proxy,
auth/OIDC, database provider, offline, backup, password policy, and operational
details.

For release-candidate validation across multiple local configurations, see the
[configuration lab](docs/CONFIG_LAB.md).

# Development

For contributor workflow, `make dev` starts the app in local single-user mode so you can reproduce editor bugs without going through login/onboarding. Use `make dev-auth` if you need to test local auth or OIDC flows from your `backend/.env`.

<details>
<summary>Clone the Repository</summary>

## Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository (recommended)
git clone git@github.com:ZimengXiong/ExcaliDash.git

# or, clone with HTTPS
# git clone https://github.com/ZimengXiong/ExcaliDash.git
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Frontend</summary>

## Frontend

```bash
cd ExcaliDash/frontend
npm install

# Copy environment file and customize if needed
cp .env.example .env

npm run dev
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Backend</summary>

## Backend

```bash
cd ExcaliDash/backend
npm install

# Copy environment file and customize if needed
cp .env.example .env

# Generate Prisma client and setup database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

npm run dev
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Simulate Auth Onboarding (Development)</summary>

### Simulate Auth Onboarding (Development)

To simulate first-run authentication choice flows in local development:

```bash
cd ExcaliDash/backend

# Preview what would change (no data modifications)
npm run dev:simulate-auth-onboarding:dry-run

# Simulate "fresh install" onboarding state
# (wipes drawings/collections/libraries and removes non-bootstrap users)
npm run dev:simulate-auth-onboarding:fresh

# Simulate "migration" onboarding state (ensures legacy data exists)
npm run dev:simulate-auth-onboarding:migration
```

After running a simulation while the backend is already running, wait about 5 seconds
(auth mode cache TTL) or restart the backend before refreshing the UI.

<details>
<summary>Setup and Operational Scripts</summary>

### Setup and Operational Scripts

In `backend/package.json` there are helper scripts for maintenance:

| Script          | Purpose                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `admin:recover` | Emergency admin credential recovery/reset. |

Admin recovery example:

```bash
cd backend
npm run admin:recover -- --identifier admin@example.com --generate --activate --must-reset
```

Common flags:

| Flag                          | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--password "<new-password>"` | Set explicit new password.                               |
| `--generate`                  | Generate a secure random password.                       |
| `--activate`                  | Activate the admin account immediately.                  |
| `--promote`                   | Promote user to admin role.                              |
| `--must-reset`                | Force password reset on first login.                     |
| `--disable-login-rate-limit`  | Temporarily disable login throttling for this operation. |
